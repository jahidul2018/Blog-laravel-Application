<p>The official&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>&nbsp;Twitter account for Japan shared this game-changing piece of information this week, showing what happens instead when Mario runs out of health in the upcoming Switch game:</p>

<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mario_odysseyJP/status/882401319398424577" target="_blank">follow-up tweet</a>, the Japanese&nbsp;<em>Odyssey</em>&nbsp;account notes that even if Mario doesn't have 10 coins, he still won't get a Game Over screen.</p>

<p>Although this is a pretty big change for the series &mdash; considering every other&nbsp;<em>Super Mario</em>&nbsp;game has had some sort of Game Over screen &mdash; the lack of a Game Over falls in line with the modernization of Nintendo's series. A Game Over screen used to indicate more than just your latest death: it meant restarting certain levels or an entire chapter of levels. In Super Mario's case: restarting kingdoms.</p>
<p>Unlike other sandbox-style games like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 64&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>,&nbsp;<em>Odyssey</em>&nbsp;doesn't kick Mario out of whatever level he's in every time he grabs a power moon (the&nbsp;<em>Odyssey</em>&nbsp;equivalent of a star or shine). This frees players to get comfortable in each kingdom rather than penalizing them every time they die by booting them back a few levels.</p>
<p>You'll still get punished for dying in&nbsp;<em>Odyssey</em>&nbsp;though &mdash; it'll cost you coins and some progress. But that doesn't hurt nearly as bad as confronting the implications behind the big, bold-lettered words "GAME OVER" that used to taunt you from the screen.</p>
