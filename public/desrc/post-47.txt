<p>&ldquo;During interrogation, he [Ivan] admitted that he raped the girl,&rdquo; Mufti Mahmud, director of legal and media wing of the elite force, told reporters at the press briefing this morning.</p>
<p>Ivan went into hiding at the rooftop of his Banani house when police were searching the house on Wednesday to arrest him following the case, Mahmud said.</p>
<p>Later, he left the place and took shelter at his relative's house in Dhaka&rsquo;s Dakshin Khan area on the same day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ivan went to his relative's house in Narayanganj, the Rab official said.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Ivan&rsquo;s father has extended his cooperation to the law enforcers providing all necessary information about the whereabouts of his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He [Ivan] dropped out from class IX of Dhaka&rsquo;s Cambrian School and College and got involved in anti-social activities including taking drugs since 2005,&rdquo; the Rab official said quoting Ivan.</p>
<p>The arrestee will be handed over to Banani Police Station for initiating legal measures against him in this connection, Mahmud added.</p>
<p>Ivan, who had come to know the girl through Facebook, invited her to his purported birthday party&nbsp;at his Banani residence on Tuesday night and then raped her, according to the first information report.</p>
