<p>Caroline Wozniacki overcame a second-set wobble to book her spot in the Wimbledon second round on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Danish fifth seed beat Hungary's world number 42 Timea Babos 6-4, 4-6, 6-1 in an hour and 42 minutes on Centre Court.</p>
<p>The former world number one will play either Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova or Italy's Sara Errani in the round of 64.</p>
<p>"I just kept fighting for every point. I was down a break early in both sets. Somehow I managed to pull it out," Wozniacki said.</p>
<p>"I feel like I'm in good shape but the first round is always tricky. She definitely gave me a lot of competition.</p>

<p>"I love playing on Centre Court. It's a very special feeling to be out there. I love playing on grass and I love Wimbledon. I'm happy to be through and hopefully I can get some good recovery."</p>
<p>Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam where Wozniacki has failed to reach at least the quarter-finals.</p>
