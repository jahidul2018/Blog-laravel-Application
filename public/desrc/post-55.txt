<p>&ldquo;I played county cricket before but it's always an opportunity for a player to play county cricket. Every experience counts and I believe the stint with Essex will also give me some experience, which will help my batting,&rdquo; said Tamim yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am still excited as I am going to play county cricket. My main aim would be to play good cricket there and fulfil my team's desire,&rdquo; added Tamim, who got his first taste of county cricket after signing for Nottinghamshire as a short-term replacement for David Hussey in June 2011.</p>
<p>If everything goes according to plan and Australia arrive in Dhaka as scheduled on August 18 then the southpaw opener will return home on August 1, otherwise his stint with Essex will be extended.</p>
<p>Australia is scheduled to arrive in Dhaka next month to play two Tests against the Tigers in Dhaka and Chittagong but the pay dispute in Australia cricket has cast doubts about the tour.</p>

<p>Tamim had received the offer from Essex after the Tigers' first two games in the ICC Champions Trophy against hosts England and Australia where the left-hander scored 128 and 95 to maintain a rare consistency in his batting.</p>
<p>Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate is the captain of the Eagles and Tamim will have former England player Ravi Bopara and Ashar Zaidi -- both of whom have played in the Dhaka Premier League and Bangladesh Premier League -- as teammates.</p>
