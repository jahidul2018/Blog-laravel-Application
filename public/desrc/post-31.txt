<p>Hulu just got a bit cooler.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In case you're still debating whether you want to fork your money over to yet another subscription service, Hulu made its service more tempting by striking a new deal with HBO and Cinemax.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conveniently just ahead of the premiere of HBO's&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>&nbsp;on July 16, Hulu users can now add HBO and Cinemax as two separate premium add-ons to their Hulu subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But don't get too excited: It's not like you're saving big bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HBO costs $14.99 per month and Cinemax costs $9.99 per month in addition to a Hulu subscription. Hulu offers three tiers: standard at $7.99 per month, ad-free at $11.99 per month, and $39.99 per month for the&nbsp;<a href="http://mashable.com/2017/05/03/hulu-with-live-tv-streaming-launch/">latest live TV plan</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HBO Now, the company's standalone service, also costs $14.99 per month on its own. You can also add a&nbsp;<a href="http://help.hbonow.com/app/answers/detailHBO/a_id/235/~/can-i-add-the-hbo-channel-to-my-amazon-prime-membership%3F" target="_blank">HBO subscription to Amazon Prime</a>, DirecTV, and Sling TV for the same cost.</p>
<p>The hook here is that you can create a Hulu bundle that's perhaps more exciting to you than a cable subscription with HBO, or HBO Now by itself, or HBO combined with any of those other services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deals are big for Hulu as it tries to woo more cord-cutters to its service, competing with the likes of YouTube, Amazon Video, Netflix, and, of course, traditional cable subscriptions. A&nbsp;<a href="http://mashable.com/2017/07/05/netflix-most-viewed-comscore/">recent comScore report revealed</a>that Netflix dominates in viewing times, commanding more than Hulu, Amazon Video, and YouTube combined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"By combining HBO's iconic programming with our world class user experience and deep content offering,&nbsp;Hulu&nbsp;is giving viewers easy and highly personalized access to the very best of television," Tim Connolly, senior VP and head of distribution and partnerships at&nbsp;Hulu, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"With this important new partnership, fans can now watch&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>&nbsp;live every&nbsp;Sunday, binge watch all six seasons of&nbsp;<em>The Sopranos</em>&nbsp;or catch up on&nbsp;<em>Westworld</em>&nbsp;alongside our live TV, sports, classic TV shows and&nbsp;Hulu&nbsp;originals &mdash; all without ever having to leave the&nbsp;Hulu&nbsp;app," he continued.</p>
<p>Hulu is also competing for subscribers by offering its&nbsp;<a href="http://mashable.com/2017/04/13/hulu-handmaids-tale-review/">own exclusive programming</a>, such as&nbsp;<em>The Handmaid's Tale</em>.</p>
