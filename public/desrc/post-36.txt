<p>A&nbsp;<em>Titanfall 2</em>&nbsp;player who goes by the name&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/iniqu1ty?lang=en" target="_blank">Iniquity</a>&nbsp;has been streaming and making entertaining&nbsp;<em>Titanfall</em>&nbsp;videos for years. After his dog Onyx passed away recently, the&nbsp;<em>Titanfall</em>&nbsp;developers at Respawn gave him a proper send-off: an in-game callsign banner.</p>

<p>Here's the banner, created by concept artist Rodrigo Ribiero:</p>
<p>Respawn posted about the banner on Reddit, paying their respects to Onyx and giving Iniquity a shoutout for his contributions to the&nbsp;<em>Titanfall</em>community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We were touched and saddened to hear about the passing of Onyx from Iniquity. Many of us at the studio are parents to pups and we can empathize with the pain of that loss. We also recognize the contributions and awesome content that Iniquity has brought to&nbsp;<em>Titanfall 2</em>&nbsp;and we're thankful to have him and other awesome community creators that have supported us and the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was incredible to see the community rally behind this cause and once we saw it our artists were inspired to support so today, we're confirming that Onyx will live on in&nbsp;<em>Titanfall 2</em>&nbsp;in the form of a callsign banner that we will include in a future DLC drop. It will be unlocked from the start so all can equip.</p>

<p>After hearing about what Respawn had done to honor his dog, Iniquity was moved.</p>
